 * Brief description of this file:
 *
 * This is an example of how to use QUESO classes and algorithms in order to define and solve
 * a statistical inverse problem (SIP) and/or a statistical forward problem (SFP).
 * The SIP consists on calibrating the magnitude 'g' of acceleration gravity using
 * measurements of the time that it takes for an object in free fall to reach the ground from
 * a given height and zero initial velocity. The solution of the SIP is the posterior
 * probability density function (PDF) of 'g'.
 * The SFP consists of calculating the maximum distance traveled by an object in projectile
 * motion. The posterior PDF of 'g' from the SIP might be used as input to the SFP.
 *
 * The code consists of 7 files:
 * - 'gravity_main.C' (this file)
 * - 'gravity_compute.C' (the driving application code)
 * - 'gravity_compute.h'
 * - 'gravity_likelihood.C' (necessary for the SIP)
 * - 'gravity_likelihood.h'
 * - 'gravity_qoi.C' (necessary for the SFP)
 * - 'gravity_qoi.h'
