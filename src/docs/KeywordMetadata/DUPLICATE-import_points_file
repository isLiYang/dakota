Blurb::
File containing variable values and corresponding responses

Description::
The \c import_points_file allows the user to specify a file that
contains a list of variable values and the model responses computed at
those values.  These can be used by a number of methods in place of
model evaluations.  When used to construct surrogate models or
emulators these are often called build points or training data.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Be default, methods do not import points from a file.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Dakota parses input files without regard to whitespace, but the
import_points_file must be in one of three formats:
\li \c annotated (default)
\li \c custom_annotated
\li \c freeform
