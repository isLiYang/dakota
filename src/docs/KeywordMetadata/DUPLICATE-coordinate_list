Values of the independent coordinates for field data
Description::
Field data involves a field quantity or response that is dependent upon some 
quantity.  For example, temperature (the field response) might be dependent on time (the independent 
coordinate).  Another example is where acceleration (the field response) might be dependent on 
a spatial (x,y,z) location, in this case on three independent coordinates. 

The \c coordinate_list specifies the actual coordinate values.  Note that the number of dimensions are defined by 
\c num_coordinates_per_field. 
The length of the coordinate list is defined by \c lengths.
If the length a particular field data response is very long (e.g. lengths = 10000), it will be 
easier to read the independent coordinates by reading a data file instead of 
specifying them with a coordinate list in the Dakota input file. For example, one could say 
\c coordinate_data_file = 'my_coord_data.dat' instead of the coordinate list values.
