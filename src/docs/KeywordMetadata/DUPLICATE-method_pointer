Pointer to sub-method to apply to surrogate
Description::
The \c method_pointer keyword is used to specify a pointer to an optimization 
or least-squares sub-method to apply to the surrogate model. 

Any \c model_pointer identified in the sub-method specification is ignored. 
Instead, the parent method is responsible for selecting a surrogate model
using its \c model_pointer.
