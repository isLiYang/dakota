Stopping criterion based on convergence of the objective function
Description::
The \c convergence_tolerance specification provides a real value for
controlling the termination of iteration.

It is a
<b> relative convergence tolerance </b> for the objective function; i.e., if
the change in the objective function between successive iterations
divided by the previous objective function is less than the amount
specified by convergence_tolerance, then this convergence criterion is
satisfied on the current iteration.

Therefore, permissible values are between 0 and 1, non-inclusive.

<b> Behavior Varies by Package/Library </b>

This control is used with optimization and least squares
iterators (DOT, CONMIN, NPSOL, NLSSOL, OPT++, and SCOLIB) and is not
used within the uncertainty quantification, design of experiments, or
parameter study iterator branches.

Since no progress may be made on
one iteration followed by significant progress on a subsequent
iteration, some libraries require that the convergence tolerance be
satisfied on two or more consecutive iterations prior to termination
of iteration. 

Notes on each library:
\li DOT: must be satisfied for two consecutive iterations 
\li NPSOL: defines
    an internal optimality tolerance which is used in evaluating if
    an iterate satisfies the first-order Kuhn-Tucker conditions for a
    minimum. The magnitude of \c convergence_tolerance approximately
    specifies the number of significant digits of accuracy desired in the
    final objective function (e.g., \c convergence_tolerance = \c 1.e-6
    will result in approximately six digits of accuracy in the final
    objective function).
