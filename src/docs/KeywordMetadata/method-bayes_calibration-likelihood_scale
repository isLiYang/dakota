Scale the log-likelihood function

Description:: 
The \c likelihood_scale is applied to the weighted sum-squared error
term of the log-likelihood function.  The log-likelihood is
-0.5*(weighted sum-squared errors)/(likelihood_scale).  Thus, if the
sum-squared errors is on the order of 1E+12, you will want to make the
likelihood scale on the order of 1E+12 or 1E+11.  Similarly, if the
weighted sum-squared errors is very small, the likelihood scale should
be very small.  <b>Note that applying a likelihood scale changes the
formulation of the calibration problem;</b> we only recommend using it
for poorly conditioned problems where the MCMC is not working without
applying scaling.
