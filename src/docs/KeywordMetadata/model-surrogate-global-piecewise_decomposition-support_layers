Optional Number of Support Layers for the Piecewise Decomposition Option of Global Surrogates

Description:: 
The piecewise decomposition option for global surrogates is used to locally approximate a function at some point using a few sample points from its neighborhood. 

The neighborhood of a cell is parameterized via a number of support layers. The (default) 0th layer contains only the direct neighbors of the cell. The 1st layer includes neighbors of the direct neighbors, etc.
