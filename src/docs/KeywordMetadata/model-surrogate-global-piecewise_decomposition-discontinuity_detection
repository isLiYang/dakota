Optional Discontinuity Detection Capability for the Piecewise Decomposition Option of Global Surrogates

Description:: 
The piecewise decomposition option for global surrogates is used to locally approximate a function at some point using a few sample points from its neighborhood.

The domain decomposition algorithm supports an optional discontinuity detection capability where seeds across a user-input discontinuity threshold can not be considered neighbors, splitting the domain into patches that trap discontinuities between their edges. This capability is specified by either a jump threshold value or a gradient threshold one.
